# AZOUL CHAT APP

## This is a dating application for marriage that we created specifically for people who suffer from infectious and chronic diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis C around the world.

			-IMANE ES-SAIYDY and AYOUB MEZHAR we are team members, have noticed that many people may be infected with infectious and chronic diseases due to marriage, shaving and beauty equipment, or due to any other coincidence. Therefore, we decided to work on the marriage part and be part of a circle that brings together infected people to live a beautiful married life based on reconciliation with the disease without concern or fear from society.  We left other matters to other officials and the World Health Organization to find other solutions that would improve the lives of infected people.
